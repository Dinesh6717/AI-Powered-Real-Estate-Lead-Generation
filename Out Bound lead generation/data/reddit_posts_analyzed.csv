Protect yourselves from Credit Agencies selling your information. www.optoutprescreen.com,The_Void_calls_me,"One of the most common questions posted here is:

**Why did I get a hundred phone calls from lenders after I got pre-approved?** 

Answer:

**Because the credit agencies sold your information.** 

How do credit agencies like Experian, Equifax and Transunion make money? 

Well one route is through something referred to as ""trigger leads"". When a lender pulls your credit, they are sending a request to the credit agencies for your credit report and score. 

When the credit agency receives this request, they know you are in the market for a loan. So they sell that ""lead"" to hundreds of other lenders looking to vulture your business. The credit agencies know everything about you. Your name, your SSN, your current debts, your phone number, your email, your current and past addresses etc. And they sell all this information. 

Well wait you might say. ""Don't I want to get a quote from hundreds of lenders to find the lowest possible rate?""

Sure. If that's why they were calling you. But a large portion of these callers are not going to offer you lower rates, they're simply trying to trick you into moving your loan, especially because buying all those leads costs money. Quite a few will lie and say they work for your current lender. Some overtly, some by omitting that they are a different lender. ""Hi! I'm just reaching out to collect the loan documents for your application!""

On the positive, they'll usually stop calling within a few days, but that's still a few days and a few hundred calls more than anyone wants to receive.

Currently the only way to stop your information from being sold is to go to the official website www.optoutprescreen.com and removing yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1hao3ij/protect_yourselves_from_credit_agencies_selling/,other,ignore

"Paid for title insurance, attorney did not purchase, and title is not clear like the attorney thought and told us.",Vegetable_Visual7148,"The title says it all. We bought a home and also paid for title insurance. The attorney did not obtain it and we essentially bought half a home and have no insurance to remedy the situation. The attorney tells us to get the heirs to sign it over and he will pay all their judgements so the transfer can take place. They obviously have no interest doing this because who would give away 1/4 of a $260,000 house for nothing that you didn‚Äôt know you owned. The attorney argues having their judgements paid is an incentive but the combined judgments are maybe $10,000 for both heirs. They also own nothing which is why they haven‚Äôt paid their 25 year old judgments. Has anyone ever been in such a situation? We aren‚Äôt sure what to do. I am in NC where you have to have an attorney to close and suing and attorney sounds like a massive headache.

Sellers lied about Survey.,KosmicCow9586,"We just recently went under contract for a 40acre raw parcel outside of Houston, Missouri. Our realt advised us not to send the earnest money until we have the survey sent from the sellers. Part of the contract/ disclosure was that the sellers in 2019 and 2024 they had the land surveyed. However, when they sent the survey to us, it was for the neighboring property. 

My husband called the surveyor and spoke with him. He told my husband that he did not survey the property we are under contract for and that there was no survey number for this parcel. After speaking with him, my husband called our realtor, and our realtor said he didn't want to cause any issues over something so minor. 

Is this something we could use to extend our due diligence period? We can not get a surveyor out there until after. 

We really love the land. However, now we feel like everything on the disclosure statement is a lie. 

Edit to add: Our property is surrounded by national forest on three sides, and the property connected to ours on the fourth side was the sellers, but they just sold that. 

Update: The realtor talked to his broker, he now is ready to fight on our behalf. He is giving them the option to send us the correct survey (which he doubts they have). If they fail to provide it, he will write up a new contract contingent on the survey we will have done.

Has anyone else noticed that homes only seem overpriced in the average price ranges?,ExpressionGeneral418,"I live in a high cost of living state, and after much research and home searching, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that the vast majority of homes in the $4-600,000 range are your cookie cutter, basic looking homes built 60-100 years ago that need tons of updates. 

Whereas if you get into the $1-3 million range homes seem exponentially better. Down in the lower ranges where the masses purchase is where you seem to overpay for old beater homes. Once you get past what is affordable to the masses, there‚Äôs essentially no competition and prices seem to match what you‚Äôre actually getting.

Doubt whether to sell now or rent,Hot-Initiative-6040,"
I started in the last year to diversify my investments by investing in real estate.

M34, I live abroad, I currently have a total assets of about 650k composed of: 207k equity ETFs, 300k real estate (market value), 42k Crypto, 12k gold ETFs, 8k bond ETFs, 25k liquidity, 50k liquidity in my company's coffers, 2-3k other

I purchased in December 2024 - after about a year and a half of research, time and attempts - an apartment in the center of a large Spanish city (Valencia). It was an opportunity, paid ‚Ç¨ 184,000, two bedrooms and with unique characteristics for the real estate market in the area, for example super bright with as many as 5 balconies.

Well, the goal was to renovate it and rent it out. In a month I renovated it (it needed a refresh, not deep work) arriving at a total investment of ‚Ç¨222,000 and I have already rented it for ‚Ç¨1,400/month for the next 4 months (my intention is to rent it for short periods like this).

I had it appraised by a real estate agency and they tell me that the market value to sell it is ‚Ç¨240-250,000.

Yesterday a friend who works in the real estate market here tells me that he has a foreign investor who is looking for exactly an apartment with these characteristics and has a lot of budget. He gives him a price: ‚Ç¨295,000. This one accepts, wants it at all costs and so I have this purchase offer in hand.

Now I have a doubt about what to do.

My goal was to buy an apartment to have an alternative income in a FIRE perspective. I could have about ‚Ç¨1,400 per month. Which net of costs and taxes would be ‚Ç¨1,050 per month. I live in a rental and I also liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhaving my own property where I could eventually go and live if they increase my rent in the future.

Or I could sell for ‚Ç¨295,000 to do a ""flipping"", realizing a capital gain of about ‚Ç¨73,000, which net of taxes and costs would be about ‚Ç¨55,000 net. However, if I want to reinvest them I would have to start looking for opportunities again and waste more time in a real estate market here in the area that has gone crazy (it took me a year and a half to manage to get an apartment, otherwise the opportunities fly away within 1 hour of publication)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1if23vj/doubt_whether_to_sell_now_or_rent/,renting a property,low

Flood history question,Ok_Equipment3952,"Bought a home last year, was told that there was not disclosure form required because it was an estate sale. Inspector noted some moisture in the basement bathroom. Seller had the plumber ‚Äúreplace the wax ring and snake pipes‚Äù. No mention of any previous issues. Basement flooded badly after closing in the same area. After much trial and error figured out that the exterior drain pipes were all collapsed from the underground downspouts. Had to dig up all the pipes and concrete to the street and replace. The basement had to be remediated and carpets, drywall, flooring all removed. Turns out nothing was covered by insurance. 

My insurance company told me that there had been a previous claim by the previous owners for water damage in the basement.  So this was not unknown. How could they get away with not disclosing this? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1if0w4v/flood_history_question/,buying a house,high

Update or not update?,cjasonac,"My wife and I are approaching an empty nest and considering selling our home in the next three years. We‚Äôve lived here for 18 years, and while it‚Äôs been well-maintained, it could use several updates.

The biggest issues:

- The furnace and water heater were here when we moved in (still working but old).

- Soffit, fascia, and siding all need repair or replacement.

- Carpet, paint, drywall repairs, etc.

- One bathroom is functional but really needs work.

I can DIY some of it, but I‚Äôd rather hire professionals. Altogether, I‚Äôm estimating $40K‚Äì$50K to get the house to a ‚Äúnew-ish‚Äù condition.

My question: Is it worth it?

I know we could just price it lower and let buyers deal with the updates, but I don‚Äôt want these issues to scare off otherwise interested buyers. On the other hand, if we do the updates, some things (like the furnace and water heater) might still need replacing in a few years anyway.

For context, we live in a medium-demand area‚Äînot skyrocketing prices, but steady turnover due to job movement. In 18 years, we‚Äôre the third-longest residents on our block, and every other house except two has sold at least once.

If we do the updates, we‚Äôd keep them neutral and in line with mid-century ranch remodel trends‚Äînothing flashy, just clean and modern.

Would the investment be worth it, or should we just sell as-is and adjust the price?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1iep26y/update_or_not_update/,selling a house,medium

Title problems and foreclosure 1 week before closing,CheeseHands2015,"I'm a FTHB and we have been ""penciled in"" to close next week. We just found out yesterday that the hold up is due to the seller having issues with getting the title, because of his ex wife? I'm honestly confused on the details.

This also is complicated because I also just found out yesterday that the seller hasn't been paying his mortgage, and the home is in preforeclosure! We had no idea about any of this prior to offering, or even signing the P&S agreement. Now I'm freaking out because I saw that this home that I'm supposed to close on the 7th, already has a scheduled auction for foreclosure on the 11th!
