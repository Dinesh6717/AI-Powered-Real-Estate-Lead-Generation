Protect yourselves from Credit Agencies selling your information. www.optoutprescreen.com,The_Void_calls_me,"One of the most common questions posted here is:

**Why did I get a hundred phone calls from lenders after I got pre-approved?** 

Answer:

**Because the credit agencies sold your information.** 

How do credit agencies like Experian, Equifax and Transunion make money? 

Well one route is through something referred to as ""trigger leads"". When a lender pulls your credit, they are sending a request to the credit agencies for your credit report and score. 

When the credit agency receives this request, they know you are in the market for a loan. So they sell that ""lead"" to hundreds of other lenders looking to vulture your business. The credit agencies know everything about you. Your name, your SSN, your current debts, your phone number, your email, your current and past addresses etc. And they sell all this information. 

Well wait you might say. ""Don't I want to get a quote from hundreds of lenders to find the lowest possible rate?""

Sure. If that's why they were calling you. But a large portion of these callers are not going to offer you lower rates, they're simply trying to trick you into moving your loan, especially because buying all those leads costs money. Quite a few will lie and say they work for your current lender. Some overtly, some by omitting that they are a different lender. ""Hi! I'm just reaching out to collect the loan documents for your application!""

On the positive, they'll usually stop calling within a few days, but that's still a few days and a few hundred calls more than anyone wants to receive.

Currently the only way to stop your information from being sold is to go to the official website www.optoutprescreen.com and removing yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1hao3ij/protect_yourselves_from_credit_agencies_selling/

"Paid for title insurance, attorney did not purchase, and title is not clear like the attorney thought and told us.",Vegetable_Visual7148,"The title says it all. We bought a home and also paid for title insurance. The attorney did not obtain it and we essentially bought half a home and have no insurance to remedy the situation. The attorney tells us to get the heirs to sign it over and he will pay all their judgements so the transfer can take place. They obviously have no interest doing this because who would give away 1/4 of a $260,000 house for nothing that you didn‚Äôt know you owned. The attorney argues having their judgements paid is an incentive but the combined judgments are maybe $10,000 for both heirs. They also own nothing which is why they haven‚Äôt paid their 25 year old judgments. Has anyone ever been in such a situation? We aren‚Äôt sure what to do.

Sellers lied about Survey.,KosmicCow9586,"We just recently went under contract for a 40acre raw parcel outside of Houston, Missouri. Our realt advised us not to send the earnest money until we have the survey sent from the sellers. Part of the contract/ disclosure was that the sellers in 2019 and 2024 they had the land surveyed. However, when they sent the survey to us, it was for the neighboring property. 

My husband called the surveyor and spoke with him. He told my husband that he did not survey the property we are under contract for and that there was no survey number for this parcel. After speaking with him, my husband called our realtor, and our realtor said he didn't want to cause any issues over something so minor. 

Is this something we could use to extend our due diligence period? We can not get a surveyor out there until after. 

We really love the land. However, now we feel like everything on the disclosure statement is a lie. 

Edit to add: Our property is surrounded by national forest on three sides, and the property connected to ours on the fourth side was the sellers, but they just sold that. 

Update: The realtor talked to his broker, he now is ready to fight on our behalf. He is giving them the option to send us the correct survey (which he doubts they have). If they fail to provide it, he will write up a new contract contingent on the survey we will have done.

Doubt whether to sell now or rent,Hot-Initiative-6040,"
I started in the last year to diversify my investments by investing in real estate.

M34, I live abroad, I currently have a total assets of about 650k composed of: 207k equity ETFs, 300k real estate (market value), 42k Crypto, 12k gold ETFs, 8k bond ETFs, 25k liquidity, 50k liquidity in my company's coffers, 2-3k other

I purchased in December 2024 - after about a year and a half of research, time and attempts - an apartment in the center of a large Spanish city (Valencia). It was an opportunity, paid ‚Ç¨ 184,000, two bedrooms and with unique characteristics for the real estate market in the area, for example super bright with as many as 5 balconies.

Well, the goal was to renovate it and rent it out. In a month I renovated it (it needed a refresh, not deep work) arriving at a total investment of ‚Ç¨222,000 and I have already rented it for ‚Ç¨1,400/month for the next 4 months (my intention is to rent it for short periods like this).

I had it appraised by a real estate agency and they tell me that the market value to sell it is ‚Ç¨240-250,000.

Yesterday a friend who works in the real estate market here tells me that he has a foreign investor who is looking for exactly an apartment with these characteristics and has a lot of budget. He gives him a price: ‚Ç¨295,000. This one accepts, wants it at all costs and so I have this purchase offer in hand.

Now I have a doubt about what to do.

My goal was to buy an apartment to have an alternative income in a FIRE perspective. I could have about ‚Ç¨1,400 per month. Which net of costs and taxes would be ‚Ç¨1,050 per month. I live in a rental and I also liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhaving my own property where I could eventually go and live if they increase my rent in the future.

Or I could sell for ‚Ç¨295,000 to do a ""flipping"", realizing a capital gain of about ‚Ç¨73,000, which net of taxes and costs would be about ‚Ç¨55,000 net. However, if I want to reinvest them I would have to start looking for opportunities again and waste more time in a real estate market here in the area that has gone crazy (it took me a year and a half to manage to get an apartment, otherwise the opportunities fly away within 1 hour of publication)",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1if23vj/doubt_whether_to_sell_now_or_rent/

Update or not update?,cjasonac,"My wife and I are approaching an empty nest and considering selling our home in the next three years. We‚Äôve lived here for 18 years, and while it‚Äôs been well-maintained, it could use several updates.

The biggest issues:

- The furnace and water heater were here when we moved in (still working but old).

- Soffit, fascia, and siding all need repair or replacement.

- Carpet, paint, drywall repairs, etc.

- One bathroom is functional but really needs work.

I can DIY some of it, but I‚Äôd rather hire professionals. Altogether, I‚Äôm estimating $40K‚Äì$50K to get the house to a ‚Äúnew-ish‚Äù condition.

My question: Is it worth it?

I know we could just price it lower and let buyers deal with the updates, but I don‚Äôt want these issues to scare off otherwise interested buyers. On the other hand, if we do the updates, some things (like the furnace and water heater) might still need replacing in a few years anyway.

For context, we live in a medium-demand area‚Äînot skyrocketing prices, but steady turnover due to job movement. In 18 years, we‚Äôre the third-longest residents on our block, and every other house except two has sold at least once.

If we do the updates, we‚Äôd keep them neutral and in line with mid-century ranch remodel trends‚Äînothing flashy, just clean and modern.

Seller changing mind during attorney review,sunflowerzz2012,"We are utterly devastated. We went under contract on this house, giving the seller everything she asked for. 30k above asking price, the quick close she wanted, as-is condition. We paid $1725 for home inspection and lead testing, and based on the results, asked for a 5k credit to remediate safety issues. We were entirely prepared for her to say no to this and to cover all repairs ourselves, but this was based on our attorney recommendation and we thought it wouldn't hurt to ask, the worst she could say is no. 

We were wrong. Apparently the worst she could say is never mind, I'm cancelling the contract, I don't want to sell you the house anymore. 

We are just gutted, we were so in love with the house, it had so many wonderful features and we never in a million years dreamed she would just change her mind like this for no apparent reason. And now on top of the emotional aspect of falling in love with something just to have it ripped away from us, we're just out these inspection fees and it's too bad so sad? I understand we'd have to forfeit that if we were the ones backing out, but we didn't even do anything. We weren't even trying to fight her on anything during this review, we just sent the attorney letter and were awaiting a response. 

Why did this happen? Is there anything we can do? Our attorney already went back to theirs revoking our requests, but it sounds like she's made up her mind to cancel. I just can't understand it. 

Edit: I would like to thank everyone for their insight, even the ones who said I was a deceitful, greedy, horrible, unreasonable person, because this provided very valuable perspective. It sounds the main sticking point is that the sale was supposed to be as is, and this is why asking for a credit was a mistake that the seller may have found insulting. This was done on the advice of our attorney, it wasn't even our idea to ask for money back, and it sounds like our attorney gave us poor advice here.

I have been following my local real estate market very closely since about May of last year.

Inventory was significantly low from 2020-2022 like most other places in the country and I stopped looking.

Inventory of existing homes started drying up in December BUT some really good deals were posted while I was away for the holidays. We‚Äôre talking 30k-40k under what comparable homes were listed at.

Buyers asking for everything in the inspection to be fixed,Mousehole_Cat,"We're selling our starter home, it's in great condition, sought after neighborhood, best school districts in the city etc. Multiple offers from the first day of selling. New HVAC and water heater, roof has 8-10 years on it, professionally painted, updated appliances, new gutters. We've done more than $50k worth of improvements over 5 years.

The buyer's inspection report found 1 safety issue (attic hatch Sheetrock depth is 1/4 inch short vs code), a few roof fixes (replace some pins, new/painted dryer vent cover) and a mix of minor issues (some caulking, stove hood light bulb replacement, 1 window screen has a small hole). It's well below the level of findings we or our realtor have seen in other inspection reports. 

The buyers have requested that every single item on the list is addressed. 

We first countered offline by saying we'd offer a $1k credit, which was the price of the attic hatch + roof repairs, or we could do these ourselves before sale. Their preference. 

They came back asking for $4k credit stating that is the contractor value of all elements they will ""need to"" fix. 

We've asked our realtor to counter and say we'll do the hatch and offer $2k credit, but to be very clear that this is exceptionally generous given they are asking for repair of minor cosmetic items that are signs of normal wear and tear. I've also asked her to highlight that we are frustrated. 

Basically, I'm more than happy to put the house back on the market over this. We're getting into the spring period, we know that inventory in our price range is low and we're comparatively high quality, so I've no concerns we'll get a quick sale likely over asking.

Strategy to help you save money on your taxes as a property owner,Zealousideal_Sell849,"I wanted to share something that many property owners and real estate investors aren't aware of and would help you keep cash in your business.

A lot of people are still depreciating their buildings over 27.5 or 39 years, but the IRS actually allows certain parts of a property (like flooring, lighting, HVAC, and other components) to be depreciated much faster-in 5, 7, or 15 years.

This process, called cost segregation, has been a game-changer for many property owners because it can lead to huge tax savings and better cash flow. It's IRS-approved, works alongside your CPA, and is especially useful if you've recently purchased, renovated, or built a property.

I've seen cases where owners were able to unlock six-figure tax savings just by reallocating depreciation correctly. Since tax season is approaching, I figured this might help someone here.

Has anyone here ever done a cost segregation study on their properties? If so, what was your experience like? And if not, l'd be happy to share more info or point you in the right direction!",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ieqjih/strategy_to_help_you_save_money_on_your_taxes_as/
House was foreclosed while under contract,lolmonsterlol,"We found a house and put in an offer and went under contract. While doing inspection we found out that they have been under foreclosure and they filed and extension to sell house. The dockets show our contract. The judged denied the extension and told them to foreclose. 

The house bedrooms have been trashed mainly with cat urine. 

Our realtor thinks we still have a chance. But these people haven‚Äôt paid the mortgage since 2023. She will go to judge next week to see if he‚Äôll accept the sale. The realtor already spoke to judge and judge said he was fed up with owners because they have lied so many times. 

The listing agent lied about a lot of things including the foreclosure status and the some repairs that need be made. 

We expect them to not do repairs. We are willing remediate the rooms. 

However, it seems like the owners literally don‚Äôt care to make the rooms even smell okay. We walked on cat urine in the kids rooms.

So basically, what are the chances of the judge allowing this? Also will the appraiser lower the value of the house seeing the condition of the floors because of the urine? 



Edit: the listing agent also lied about the roof, the generator, the plumbing, and few other things. The roof is in great condition so I don‚Äôt know why she would lie.

Along with a few other minor things, this was not disclosed anywhere to me in the process of getting my home. When I asked the previous homeowners (through our realtors), they denied everything I asked about. 

I discovered today that my house has flooded and it is coming from the crawlspace. I did have a home inspection done, but I ended up getting my money back from the inspection. 

Would I have a case against the previous homeowners for not disclosing the flooding issues? I have pictures from when I moved it from the water lines and water stains. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ienx8c/would_i_have_a_case_against_the_previous/

MCC Question,Keip65,"My wife and I are first-time homebuyers. We are purchasing a new build, and financing through the builder for the initial loan. It will be sold to another party some time after we close. The lender told us they do not participate in the MCC program.

Does anyone know if we could apply for a MCC if we were to refinance? (I don't think I'll want to refinance, because we're getting a really good interest rate)

Is there a way I could apply for the MCC without going through the lender?

I've been told to get a MCC if I could, and I'm having a hard time finding these answers on the internet. I would like to know my options.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1iehh8h/mcc_question/

First time going to an open house,Censordoll,"Hello. To start, this is the first time I‚Äôve posted on this sub, and this is the first time I‚Äôve done or would do anything related to potential home buying. 

I live in the U.S. in Southern California. 
my husband and I would like to see the inside of a town home that we could potentially afford. We haven‚Äôt done anything in terms of making any moves to purchase any home, and we just want to see the inside of this town home or of any home within our potential price range. 

I saw on Zillow and Redfin this town home is open to making an appointment for a walk through. 

Is there anything I need to prepare for? Or any advice when dealing with an agent that would be there to allow us to access the home? Or any information we would have to provide, if any?

Built in the late 90s, slab foundation, appears to be in good shape with ~6 year old roof and HVAC, and 2 year old water heater.

"Advice on Raising Rent for a Rental Property in Mountlake Terrace, WA?",Superb-Foundation661,"Hey Reddit! My mom has a rental property in Mountlake Terrace, WA, that she‚Äôs been renting out for $2,500/month for the last 15 years. The house is a bit ‚Äúbeat down,‚Äù but it‚Äôs in a really good location. Zillow estimates the rent should be around $3,327, but she‚Äôs never raised the rent much because of the property's condition and the long-term tenants.

The current tenants just left, and now my mom‚Äôs freaking out about finding a new tenant, especially with the rent being so much lower than what other listings in the area are going for.

We have a property manager (Circle Point Homes), but I wanted to get some opinions from people who‚Äôve been in similar situations. Should we raise the rent to match the Zillow estimate? What factors should we consider (besides condition and location) when deciding on a rental price? Also, how much leeway do we have to raise the rent without losing potential tenants?

I‚Äôm just a kid trying to figure this out‚Äîmy mom sort of threw this responsibility on me. I want to make sure she‚Äôs getting her money‚Äôs worth, but also treat future tenants with respect and keep the place at a fair, livable price.

Agent refused offer without informing us first,Open_Employment_560,"So we‚Äôre selling a distressed property (long story short we bought it to flip it but our plans changed and we are moving out of the country). We are working with a realtor whose boss had an interested buyer who made an offer before the house even went on sale. It was a bit below asking but with a contingency of a long due diligence period (during which our house goes off market). We countered with a slightly higher price, specifying to our agent that we would not go lower than that. 

Over the next few days, our agent rejected several offers which were lower than our counter to the first offer, without telling us, based on the fad that we said we‚Äôd not accept anything lower - however we meant we wouldn‚Äôt accept any lower from THAT PARTICULAR buyer with that particular unusual contingency. Do you think we are right to be upset? She apologized and said she‚Äôd present our counter offers to the other interested buyers but were afraid it‚Äôs too late. 

Edit: so do you guys think (or is this my paranoia) that the agent might not be working in our best interest here in order to get the deal for her boss‚Äôs colleague?

Edit 2: since the post created quite a discussion as to the details and how exactly I worded the counter offer, here it is copy and paste:

‚ÄòHi [agent name], Please thank the person making the first offer for her patience. We‚Äôd like to counter at 570,000. Please let her know, which I know you‚Äôll do much more professionally than we can put into words, that this is the lowest we will go.

"Seller didn't disclose everything, house falling apart",ThinkingRose,"On mobile, sorry for formatting. Also this is Illinois.


Partner and I bought a house late last year in cash. We waived inspection contingency because we'd already lost nearly a dozen bids and were living with his parents while house hunting. Sellers disclosure mentioned some minor water in basement during heavy storms but no other issues. Listing stated new roof, kitchen and bathroom remodel in the last 5 years.


Offer was accepted and we requested a day to have an inspector go out just so we could see what we were getting into, we would've been fine with whatever it was since we were told new roof and no structural issues (our 2 big no-no's). Seller refused to allow an inspection and refused to allow us to go in ourselves again before closing. We decided to go ahead with the sale anyway (I know, but whatever).


Now we're dealing with water coming into our living room because the roof is crap, either installed wrong or older than stated. Basement is flooding, not finished so whatever, but it's causing excess humidity. And today we noticed water coming down the exposed chimney in the dining room. 


There's no way the previous owners didn't know about these issues as we removed the particle board covering the chimney after moving in to make it look better. Beneath it was black tar paper that we looked up and saw it's used to prevent mold in moist areas. There's also evidence of previous mold cleanup on the chimney and some roof slats in the attic. None of this was disclosed.


What are our options? Do we go after the previous owner, the listing agent, the roofer, or all three?

Thank you in advance for any advice. Please do not berate us for waiving inspection, we learned our lesson.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ietx2s/seller_didnt_disclose_everything_house_falling/
